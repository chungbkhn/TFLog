     Writes the textual representation of `object` and a newline character into the standard output.

     This function also augments the original function with the filename, function name, and line number of the object that is being logged.
     - parameter object:   A textual representation of the object.
     - parameter file:     Defaults to the name of the file that called log(). Do not override this default.
     - parameter function: Defaults to the name of the function within the file in which log() was called. Do not override this default.
     - parameter line:     Defaults to the line number within the file in which log() was called. Do not override this default.
